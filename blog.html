            <div class="col-12 col-lg-6  p-5">Hey guys! Mal here back to share a common problem that has some easy solutions. It all started when my sister’s new husband (who is from New Zealand) came to America and said “why do so many apartments in LA not have overhead lighting?!” I absolutely could not answer that question but I, too, have been baffled by this. I found this out the hard way with my very first apartment in college – we toured the apartment, said “well this’ll do,” signed the lease and moved all of our stuff in. It wasn’t until around 6 pm when I tried to turn on my light in my room, because it was getting dark, that I realized there was in fact no light switch/overhead light fixture (cool). I remember rushing to a HomeGoods to secure literally any lamp. Not ideal, clearly. So after all that, I realized this was an issue for a lot of people, ESPECIALLY in LA. So, if you’re in a new space and just realized you have no overhead lighting OR if you want to get more lighting in your space that’s easy and renter-friendly (aka non-invasive).<br>
                <br>
                Let’s get down to the basics, shall we? There are 3 types of lighting to add to a space: general/ambient, task/directional, and accent lighting. Let’s break down what each of these are: <br><br>
                GENERAL/AMBIENT - This type of lighting is mainly overhead, recessed, or other lighting that provides a lot of light in a room in a diffused way. <br><br>
                TASK/DIRECTIONAL - A task light refers to a light that’s specific to a task (wild, right?). Basically, a lamp that emits light in one direction (kinda like a spotlight). <br><br>
                ACCENT LIGHTING - Now accent lighting usually would be considered purely decorative lighting since these lights typically do not bring a lot of general diffused light to a room but more serve as an accent piece or have exposed bulbs which can often be harsh to look into. Accent lighting really just helps add a extra light and style.

            <div class="col-12 col-lg-6  p-5">This year’s South by Southwest (SXSW) festival saw its usual lineup of bands and films, but another more pressing topic was on the table. "It’s existentially urgent that we find new ways to shelter ourselves," says Jason Ballard, cofounder and CEO of Icon, an Austin-based construction start-up. "The homes and buildings of our future have to be profoundly different than they are today." For Icon and other disruptors in the construction industry, the solution isn’t about optimizing human labor or materials, but rather, building with robots.<br>
                <br>
                Ballard and his company are imagining a future where all our housing needs are 3D printed using advanced tech. "It’s time for the built environment to join the digital automated robotic revolution that has brought so much good to other industries," Ballard says.
                
                
                Four years ago, Icon unveiled the world’s first permitted 3D-printed home at SXSW. That house was designed as a prototype affordable housing unit, and it was later translated into several tiny home villages that the company has helped to build. This year, Icon presented their latest achievement, House Zero.
                Designed by Lake Flato Architects in the likeness of a ranch-style residence, the model home is arguably the most advanced formal expression of 3D-printed residential design to date. Its undulating, textural printed concrete walls are interspersed with windows that stretch from floor to ceiling, where a flat traditional timber roof caps it off. "It’s important to do deliberately provocative houses like House Zero," says Ballard. "It’s about shifting people’s imaginative window about what modern housing can be."
                While it’s good to invite people to dream, what about 3D-printing’s promise to actually create and provide shelter? Is this something people want or need? And what kind of shelter is it, exactly? 
                
                For a select group of global citizens who’ve found themselves living in a 3D-printed homes, while the reality may not be quite as glamorous as House Zero, it’s nevertheless been surprisingly comfortable.

            <div class="col-12 col-lg-6  p-5">I have a bit of a history when it comes to waiting “too long” to hang curtains. For some reason, I don’t prioritize them (as long as privacy isn’t an issue) and I’ve learned that’s ALWAYS a mistake. I am never not instantly taken aback by how much they change a room for the better. I’m talking INSTANT elevation, INSTANT coziness, INSTANT “I look like I have my life together”. But I know that depending on how many windows are in need of dressing, it can really add up. I’m sure this news is news to no one. So unless you have windows that require a custom route, let’s get into some window treatments that will take it easier on your wallet.<br>
                <br>
                First, let’s start with a very fun fact. The curtains in the opening photo, the photo above (my old apartment), and the two side-by-side photos below all have different curtains from IKEA. Look at how they all frame and bring a calming softness to each room. I doubt anyone would guess that they were from IKEA and for that we are IKEA neutral-colored curtain fans at EHD for lyfe.
                <br><br>
                
                Another reason why these look higher end is because of how they are hung. The rod is hung at 2/3 the distance between the window and ceiling. AKA GO HIGH! Unless you have a special situation where your rod must be hung closer to the top of the window, it will always look better and make your ceiling feel taller. We promise. Here is a post dedicated to how to hang curtains if you want some more guidance:)
